# Project-on-a-Salary-Dataset-from-Kaggle
This project explores a salary dataset using Python to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. It covers essential data analysis steps such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and basic statistical evaluation.  
The goal of this project is to understand how different factors relate to salary levels and to build foundational skills in data analysis and Python programming.

## Key Highlights
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Statistical insights and interpretation  
- Python libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib  

## Purpose
This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to real-world data analysis workflows, helping me strengthen my skills in Python, data exploration, and interpreting analytical results.
